!!! info "RESEARCH TOPICS"
    My Ph.D. research topic is __Distributed Edge Intelligence Enabling Framework for IoT-based Structural Health Monitoring: TinySHM__, focusing on developing a distributed edge intelligence enabling framework which is specially designed for low-cost and resource-constrained edge devices in IoT-based structural health monitoring.

!!! info "KEY TASKS"
    - IoT Hardware Prototyping: Front-end (MCU level, low-cost & resource-constrained) and back-end development
    - Distributed Edge Intelligence Enabling Framework Development: TinySHM
    - Structural Health Monitoring Applications: Measurement / System Identification / Damage Detection
