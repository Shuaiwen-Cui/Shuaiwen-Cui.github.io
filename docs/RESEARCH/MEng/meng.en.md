!!! info "RESEARCH TOPICS"
    My M.Eng. research topic is __Algorithm for Random Generation of 3D Mesoscopic Shape of Granular Materials along with Its Application to TBM Tunnelling in Stratum with Boulders__, focusing on the development of a novel algorithm for the generation of 3D polyhedrons for the simulation of rock particles by Discrete Element Method (DEM) and its application to tunneling in a boulder-soil matrix.

!!! info "KEY TASKS"
    - Developed a novel algorithm for the generation of 3D polyhedrons
    - DEM simulation of TBM tunneling in a boulder-soil matrix
    - Experimental validation by devising a mini TBM tunneling test
