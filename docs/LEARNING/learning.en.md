# __LEARNING__

    This column is a showcase of the domains I focus on or am actively learning, serving as a simplified version of my technical blog which can be found [here](http://www.cuishuaiwen.com:8000/). I divide this column into two parts: Engineering & Practice and Theory & Algorithms.

!!!note "PART A: ENGINEERING & PRACTICE"
    This part serves as the foundation.

## __EMBEDDED SYSTEMS__

## __INTERNET OF THINGS & DIGITAL TWIN__

!!!note "PART B: THEORY & ALGORITHMS"
    This part serves as the superstructure.
    
## __DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING__

## __ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE__
